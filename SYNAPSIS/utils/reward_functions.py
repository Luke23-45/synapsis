"""
SOTA Reward Functions Module.

This module implements a hybrid learned-heuristic reward system for robotic pick-and-place tasks.
It draws from key research:
- Potential-based shaping (Ng et al., 1999) to preserve policy optimality and avoid reward hacking.
- Phase decomposition with dedicated sub-rewards (Schubert et al., ICLR 2021; PMC 2023) for gradient alignment.
- Physics-informed terms (Lambrechts et al., NeurIPS 2023) for stability (e.g., velocity/torque constraints).
- Unsupervised/contrastive shaping (arXiv:2209.12350, 2022) as a proxy for learned rewards without full IRL.
- Multi-objective weighting with annealing (RSS 2018) for curriculum learning.

Key Upgrades (v4.0):
1. **Potential-Based Shaping**: All dense terms (e.g., distance, alignment) are reformulated as F(s,s') = γ Φ(s') - Φ(s),
   ensuring the shaped reward does not alter the optimal policy while providing smooth guidance.
2. **Hybrid Heuristic-Learned**: Heuristic base augmented with a simple contrastive "learned" component (embedding distance
   to expert-like states), approximating IRL/GAIL without external training (uses torch for lightweight computation).
3. **Enhanced Phase Logic**: More robust inference with sub-phases (e.g., pre-lift verification); uses object velocity
   for stability confirmation, reducing brittleness.
4. **Orientation & Physics Integration**: Geodesic quaternion errors for alignment; energy penalties (torque^2 + vel^2).
5. **Curriculum Annealing**: Dense shaping weights decay over epochs (configurable), transitioning to sparse for robustness.
6. **Constraints as Costs**: Separate safety costs (e.g., high torque, collisions) for use in advantage calculation.
7. **Robustness**: Adaptive thresholds (e.g., hover based on reach); handles noisy/missing data with imputation.

This ensures sample-efficient, stable AWR training aligned with pick-place success (stable placement).
